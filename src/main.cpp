  *
  * This is the main file for gravMat, a small program that renders matter
  * in a Universe distributed via Simplex Noise and moving according to
  * the gravity between all matter particles.

  * 0.8.3     2011-10-16  sed, PrydeWorX  Version bump to new pwxLib release version
  * 0.8.3.1   2011-10-17  sed, PrydeWorX  Corrected the help text, had old WiP title
  * 0.8.3.2   2011-11-30  sed, PrydeWorX  The rendering has been rewritten and is now a simple ray tracer
  * 0.8.3.3   2011-12-01  sed, PrydeWorX  Eventually fixed the halo pixel projection
  *                                       Fixed a bug that could lead to a crash if a halo is consumed by a split
  *                                       Changed the rendering system to deep view
  * 0.8.3.4   2011-12-03  sed, PrydeWorX  The rendering finally works as wanted.
  * 0.8.3.5   2011-12-05  sed, PrydeWorX  Fixed initial offset calculation and eventually got the shockwave
  *                                       mode right.
  * 0.8.3.6   2011-12-08  sed, PrydeWorX  Eventually finished switching from blind values to kg/m (MKS system of units)
  *                                       Fixed the workloop, it never calculated collisions correctly after
  *                                       loading a later state
  * 0.8.3.7   2011-12-11  sed, PrydeWorX  The projection is done by env only now and might a) move pixels and b) shorten
  *                                       halo ranges accordingly.
  *                                       The projection offset is no longer calculated using the center, but the nearest
  *                                       mass position of the unit.
  *                                       The window now refreshes after being minimized or overlapped
  *                                       Stats are now displayed fully everywhere.
  * 0.8.3.8   2011-12-30  sed, PrydeWorX  Finalized renderer and added dynamic constants to add MKS system of units to the
  *                                       physics engine.
  * 0.8.3.9   2012-01-04  sed, PrydeWorX  The calculation of the mass radius has been adapted to MKS.
  *                                       Finally got the maxZ calculation right and eventually silenced the moaning of
  *                                       cppcheck
  * 0.8.3.10  2012-01-10  sed, PrydeWorX  Fixed and simplified initial maximum offset values
  * 0.8.3.11  2012-01-11  sed, PrydeWorX  Changed matter initialization to reflect new MKS system
  *                                       Eventually I found the time to add an icon...
  * 0.8.3.12  2012-02-14  sed, PrydeWorX  Changed the colormap to use the new pwxLib component CWaveColor
  * 0.8.3.13  2012-02-15  sed, PrydeWorX  As Halos are Dust Spheres, the code has been changed to reflect that.
  *                                       Dust Spheres span fully around the masses now.
  * 0.8.3.14  2012-02-16  sed, PrydeWorX  Finished changing halos to dust spheres.
  * 0.8.3.15  2012-02-24  sed, PrydeWorX  Fully applied time scaling in a way the calculations can be stayed being done
  *                                       each second. Further the saving between cycles is possible now without losing
  *                                       information.
  * 0.8.5     2012-03-01  sed, PrydeWorX  Version bump to new pwxLib release version
  * 0.8.5.1   2012-03-13  sed, PrydeWorX  Saving is now done every minute or before a new gravitation calculation is needed.
  *                                       Units are no longer cleaned up unless a frame has been drawn.
  * 0.8.5.2   2012-03-20  sed, PrydeWorX  Added an option --dyncam to have the camera being moved dynamically towards the
  *                                       scene with the original distance being the maximum distance.
  * 0.8.6     2012-04-??  sed, PrydeWorX  Version bump to new pwxLib release version
