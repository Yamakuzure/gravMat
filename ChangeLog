gravMat Revision History
------------------------

0.8.5.2 - 2012-03-20
 * Added an option --dyncam to have the camera being moved dynamically towards
   the scene with the original distance being the maximum distance.

0.8.5.1 - 2012-03-13
 * Saving is now done every minute or before a new gravitation calculation is
   needed.
 * Units are no longer cleaned up unless a frame has been drawn.

0.8.3.15 - 2012-02-24
 * Fully applied time scaling in a way the calculations can be stayed being
   done each second.
 * The saving between cycles is possible now without losing information.

0.8.3.14 - 2012-02-16
 * Finished changing halos to dust spheres.

0.8.3.13 - 2012-02-15
 * As Halos are Dust Spheres, the code has been changed to reflect that.
 * Dust Spheres span fully around the masses now.

0.8.3.12 - 2012-02-14
 * Changed the colormap to use the new pwxLib component CWaveColor.

0.8.3.11 - 2012-01-11
 * Changed matter initialization to reflect new MKS system.
 * Eventually I found the time to add an icon...

0.8.3.10 - 2012-01-10
 * Fixed and simplified initial maximum offset values.

0.8.3.9 - 2012-01-04
 * The calculation of the mass radius has been adapted to MKS.
 * Finally got the maxZ calculation right and eventually silenced the moaning of
   cppcheck.

0.8.3.8 - 2011-12-30
 * Finalized renderer and added dynamic constants to add MKS system of units to
   the physics engine.

0.8.3.7 - 2011-12-11
 * The projection is done by env only now and might
   a) move pixels and
   b) shorten halo ranges accordingly.
 * The projection offset is no longer calculated using the center, but the
   nearest mass position of the unit.
 * The window now refreshes after being minimized or overlapped.
 * Stats are now displayed fully everywhere.

0.8.3.6 - 2011-12-08
 * Eventually finished switching from blind values to kg/m (MKS system).
 * Fixed the workloop, it never calculated collisions correctly after loading a
   later state

0.8.3.5 - 2011-12-05
 * Fixed initial offset calculation and eventually got the shockwave mode right.

0.8.3.4 - 2011-12-03
 * The rendering finally works as wanted.

0.8.3.3 - 2011-12-01
 * Eventually fixed the halo pixel projection.
 * Fixed a bug that could lead to a crash if a halo is consumed by a split.
 * Changed the rendering system to deep view.

0.8.3.2 - 2011-11-30
 * The rendering has been rewritten and is now a simple ray tracer.

0.8.3.1 - 2011-10-17
 * Corrected the help text, had old WiP title.

0.8.2.1 - 2011-10-15
 * Complete rewrite of the rendering.

0.8.1.2 - 2011-10-06
 * Drawing of units has been completely rewritten.

0.8.1.1 - 2011-10-05
 * Added a third distribution mode --shockwave.

0.1.0 - 2011-09-02
 * First working version

0.0.1 - 2011-07-20
 * initial design
